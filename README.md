## Hi there 👋

I’m [Ryz](https://elricbeaujot.pythonanywhere.com), a cybersecurity student based in France.

I study and build projects that help me explore the world of ethical hacking and security.

If I get an idea for something useful or challenging, I’ll probably build it, test it, and share it.

My main tech stack includes Python, Bash, and tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and SQLmap. I also enjoy working with Kali Linux and setting up vulnerable environments such as Metasploitable.

If you’re curious about how I learn and practice cybersecurity, feel free to check out my notes and write-ups!

**Fun Facts:**
- I have a cat and a dog  
- I don’t like coffee or tea  
- I like animes like Tokyo Ghoul, FMAB or Black Clover
- Hobbies: anime, formula 1, learning languages, building things
